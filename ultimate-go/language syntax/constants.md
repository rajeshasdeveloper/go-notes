-   Constants are not variable.
-   They exists only at the compile time.
-   There are two types of constants, constants of a kind and constants of a type.
-   Implicit type conversion is applied for the constants of kind (untyped)
-   There is no implicit conversion for the typed constants.
-   The constants of type kind has to be at least of 256 bits of precision.
-   All of the constants of type duration represents the int64 value.
-   usage of iota
