-   Type is the life of program.
-   type provides two informations.
    -   _Size_ - how much memory needed to r/w in the given time.
    -   _representation_ - what is represents.
-   if we don't understand size, then we don't understand cost.
-   64 bit archutecture means it's pointer size and address size is going to be 64 bit.
-   Go playground we are seeing is single threaded AMD64 p32 architcture (native client architecture) - means address size is 32 bits
-   always use var when intializing a variable with zero value (for int).
-   Go doesn't have casting but has conversion, it created the new memory and it is always safer than sorry.
-   integrity plays to keep our data and memory safe.
