-   Everything in Go is pass by value.
-   It is wizzywig - means what you see is what you get.
-   Go mainly focuses on integrity and minimizing the resources.
-   value semantics:
    -   OS allocates 1 thread or logical processor to the Go process.
    -   1 OS thread usually gets allocated with stack of 1 Megabytes of memory
    -   Go follows similar approach to creates its own light-weight thread named Goroutine with stack of 2 Kilobytes (4K for long time) of memory allocated to each goroutine.
    -   Go creates the frame of the memory of the stack (sliced from the 1 Meg allocated by the OS).
    -   go creates the copy of the data in its own memory frame.
    -   Goroutine only has direct access to its memory frame it is operating on.
    -   It gives the immutability means the goroutine can cause problems in the scope of frame not at the programming level.
    -   Every time we make function calls, Go creates the new goroutine for us.
    -   It giving the isolation.
    -   Disadvantages:
        -   We have multiple copies of the same data into the multiple memory frames.
        -   This is called value semantics.
        -   Sometimes it increases the code complexity.
        -   The efficiency of value semantics results in safer code but increasing the memory significantly and affecting performance.
