-   This ensures to share the a piece of ata across the program boundary.
-   If you don't want to share the data, we don't need pointers and pointer semantics.
-   Pointer semantics
    -   Goroutine doesn't have direct access to the memory frame outside program boundary
    -   If is needed to access/mutate the memory outside the active frame, need to pass the address of the data.
    -   We need to be very careful when using pointer semantics as it has possibility of causing high side effects.
    -   Any memory below the active frame is not valid memory.
    -   When main makes a function call, it need an other memory frame and when it takes a new frame, it is going to clean the non active frames
    -   So memory below the active frame no longer has an integrity
